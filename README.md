# objectdetect

An AI image detection model that can tell the user what objects are in an image. I built this around the ImageAI algorithm that uses the mobilenet v2 neural network. I've always had a huge interest in AI, but I was very intimidated by it. I felt this project was a great introduction, nothing is over complicated and it's very straight forward. Some challenges I faced through this project were trying to find the perfect network. Yolov3 was the most accurate one.
